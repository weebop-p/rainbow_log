Creamy Chicken Mushroom Pasta Recipe

Serves: 4

Ingredients:
- 400g pasta (linguine, rigatoni, or penne)
- 2 large cooked chicken breasts, sliced (optional)
- 300g mixed mushrooms, sliced (such as cremini, button, or portobello)
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 1 onion, finely chopped
- 200ml heavy cream (or a lighter alternative like half-and-half)
- 100ml white wine (optional)
- 100g parmesan cheese, grated
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Fresh herbs (parsley, thyme, or basil), chopped for garnish
- Optional vegetables: diced zucchini, sun-dried tomatoes, sliced bell peppers, or leeks

Recipe:
1. Cook the pasta according to package instructions in a large pot of salted boiling water until al dente. Drain and set aside.
2. While pasta is cooking, heat olive oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add the onions and garlic, saut√©ing until translucent.
3. Add the mushrooms and optional vegetables (zucchini, sun-dried tomatoes, peppers, or leeks). Cook until the mushrooms are soft.
4. Pour in the white wine if using and let it reduce for about 2 minutes.
5. Lower the heat and add the cream, parmesan cheese, salt, and pepper. Stir and simmer until the sauce thickens slightly.
6. If including chicken, add the cooked slices to the sauce and heat through.
7. Toss the cooked pasta into the sauce, coating evenly.
8. Serve hot, garnished with fresh herbs and additional parmesan cheese if desired.

Note: For a vegetarian version, simply omit the chicken.
