Name: Creamy Alfredo Pasta with Rigatoni (Optional Chicken)
Ingredients: butter, garlic cloves (crushed or finely grated), double cream, Italian dried herbs (or a mix of oregano, basil, and thyme), parmesan (grated), parsley (finely chopped and some reserved for garnish), rigatoni pasta, chicken breast (optional)
Recipe: 
1. If using chicken, season one chicken breast with salt and pepper. Heat a skillet over medium heat, add a bit of oil, and cook the chicken until fully cooked through. Once done, set aside and slice or dice it into bite-sized pieces.
2. Begin by boiling water in a large pot. Once boiling, add a pinch of salt and 400g of rigatoni pasta. Cook according to the package instructions or until al dente. Drain and set aside.
3. In a separate pan, melt 25g of butter over medium-low heat. Add 2 crushed garlic cloves and saut√© for about a minute, ensuring it doesn't brown.
4. Pour in 300ml of double cream and add 1 tsp of Italian dried herbs or your mix. Mix well and allow the mixture to come to a gentle simmer.
5. Gradually add 100g of grated parmesan cheese, stirring continuously until the sauce is smooth.
6. If you've prepared chicken, add it to the sauce now and stir well.
7. Add half of a small bunch of finely chopped parsley to the sauce, reserving a bit for garnish.
8. Fold the cooked rigatoni pasta into the sauce, ensuring the pasta is well-coated.
9. Serve hot, garnishing with the reserved parsley.
