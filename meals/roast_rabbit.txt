Name: Roasted Rabbit with Shallots, Wine, and Rosemary


Ingredients: 1 whole rabbit, white wine, 4 to 5 shallots, fresh rosemary, garlic, olive oil, chicken stock, vegetable stock


Recipe: 
1. Marinade: In a  bowl, combine the rabbit pieces, 1 cup of white wine, 2 cloves of minced garlic, a couple of sprigs of rosemary (leaves removed
 from stems), and a pinch of salt and pepper.Ensure the rabbit pieces are well coated. Cover the bowl and let the rabbit marinate for at least 2
  hours, preferably overnight in the refrigerator. If marinating overnight, remove from the fridge about 30 minutes prior to cooking to bring it
  to room temperature.

2. Preheat the Oven: Preheat your oven to 165°C.

3. Searing the Rabbit: In a large skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the rabbit pieces, allowing them to sear
 until they develop a nice brown color on all sides. Transfer the seared rabbit pieces to a ceramic roasting dish.

4. Sauté the Shallots and Garlic: Reduce the heat to medium in the skillet. Add a bit more oil if necessary. Add 4 or 5 diced shallots,
 sautéing them until they begin to soften and turn translucent (about 2-3 minutes). Add the 2 cloves minced garlic and sauté for another
  30 seconds to a minute, ensuring the garlic doesn’t burn.

5. Assembly for Roasting: Transfer the sautéed shallots and garlic over the rabbit pieces in the roasting dish. Pour the reserved marinade (wine mixture)
 over the rabbit. If you're using stock for additional sauce, 1 cup now. Place a couple of rosemary sprigs on top.

6. Roasting: Cover the ceramic roasting dish with its lid. Place it in the oven and cook for about 1.5 to 2 hours
 or until the rabbit is tender. Check occasionally to ensure there's enough liquid in the dish. If it's getting too dry, you can add a bit more stock or water.

7. Once cooked, remove from the oven and let it rest for about 10 minutes before serving.

8. Serve the rabbit with desired sides. The sauce in the dish, rich with the flavors of wine, shallots, and rosemary, can be drizzled over the rabbit or even thickened on the stovetop to create a more gravy-like consistency if desired.

9. Enjoy your meal!
