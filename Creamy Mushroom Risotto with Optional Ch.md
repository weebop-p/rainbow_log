Creamy Mushroom Risotto with Optional Chicken

Ingredients:
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 small onion, finely chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 250 grams arborio rice
- 100 ml white wine
- 700 ml vegetable stock, kept warm
- 300 grams mushrooms, cleaned and sliced (choose varieties like cremini and shiitake for versatility)
- 1 tablespoon fresh thyme leaves (or 1 teaspoon dried thyme)
- 30 grams grated Parmesan cheese (more for serving)
- Salt and black pepper to taste
- Optional: pre-cooked chicken, diced or shredded
- Optional vegetable add-ins: diced zucchini, chopped sun-dried tomatoes, sliced bell peppers, or sliced leeks

Instructions:
1. In a large pan, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add onion and garlic, sauté until softened.
2. Stir in the arborio rice, coating it with the oil. Cook for 1-2 minutes until the edges become translucent.
3. Pour in the white wine, stirring until it is absorbed by the rice.
4. Add the vegetable stock one ladle at a time, stirring continuously, allowing the liquid to be absorbed before adding more.
5. In a separate pan, sauté the mushrooms in a bit of olive oil until they are browned and set them aside.
6. Once the rice is almost tender and the risotto has a creamy consistency, stir in the cooked mushrooms, thyme, and the optional vegetables. Cook for an additional 2-3 minutes.
7. If using chicken, add it now to warm through with the risotto.
8. Remove from heat, stir in the Parmesan cheese, and season with salt and black pepper.
9. Serve immediately with extra Parmesan cheese on top if desired.

Enjoy your Creamy Mushroom Risotto with or without the optional chicken and vegetables!
